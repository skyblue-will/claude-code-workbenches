# Managing multiple terminals remotely with Claude Code

Run as many Claude Code terminals as you want on a machine, and reach each one
from anywhere, including your phone: the Claude.ai web app, the desktop app, SSH,
or a local terminal. They keep running when you disconnect.

## Workbenches

A workbench is just a terminal. It's the name I give them, because that's how one
feels to use: a single space where you bring together agents, tools, and context
to do a piece of work. That's why I use this. You build your own architecture on
top of it.

Each one is a remote-controlled session you spawn on demand, and any terminal can
spawn more from inside itself. The only limit is RAM. The rest of this is how to
build one. **[WIRING.md](WIRING.md) is how many of them become a working system**:
the front door, repos as memory, seed prompts, skills, fan-out, gates, and picking
work back up.

## What's actually running where

Three ingredients, and it helps to be plain about each:

- **An always-on machine.** Yes, a computer is left on somewhere: deliberately not
  the one on your desk. A cheap VPS is plenty. Your laptop can sleep; the
  terminals don't.
- **tmux.** If you haven't met it: tmux runs terminal sessions on a machine that
  keep running after you disconnect. You attach to a session to see it, detach,
  and it carries on. That's the whole trick this recipe borrows: the terminal
  belongs to the box, not to your screen.
- **Remote Control.** Claude Code's own feature that puts a running session in
  your claude.ai session list, so you can drive it from the web app, the desktop
  app, or your phone. It looks like any other Claude Code session in the app; the
  difference is where it's running.

### How this differs from plain Remote Control

Remote Control on its own already lets you drive a session from your phone. But
the session lives and dies with the terminal you started it in. If that's your
laptop, the laptop has to stay on and awake, and every new session means going
back to the machine to start it.

Move the terminals to an always-on box under tmux and both limits go: sessions
survive you disconnecting, sleeping, or losing signal, and because a session can
run the spawn script itself, you ask an existing session for a new one instead of
touching the box. Not a new feature, just Remote Control given a home that never
closes.

## The whole thing in one command

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s myagent -c ~/myproject
tmux send-keys -t myagent \
  'claude --remote-control "myagent" --dangerously-skip-permissions' Enter
```

A detached tmux session named `myagent`, running Claude Code with Remote Control
on. The rest of this README covers the flags, how to hand it a first prompt
safely, and how to get back in.

## The flags

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--remote-control [name]` | Turn on Remote Control and optionally name the session. A named session maps the app and URL to a name you chose. |
| `--remote-control-session-name-prefix <prefix>` | Auto-generate the name from a prefix instead (Claude appends a unique suffix). The default prefix is the hostname. |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Run tool calls without prompting, so the session works unattended. Use it only in a trusted or sandboxed environment. |
| `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` | A softer form that makes the skip available without turning it on by default. |
| `--plugin-dir <path>` | Load a plugin (custom skills, persona, commands) from a directory or `.zip` for this session. Repeatable. Optional. |

Two ways to name the Remote Control session:

- **Named**: `--remote-control "myagent"` gives the session exactly that name. Map
  it one-to-one to your tmux session.
- **Prefix**: `--remote-control-session-name-prefix myagent` produces
  `myagent-<suffix>`. Useful when a script starts several at once and you want
  unique names.

## tmux: the detached session

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s <name> -c <dir>
```

- `-d` starts the session detached, in the background, so it keeps running with
  nothing attached.
- `-s <name>` sets the session name you attach by.
- `-c <dir>` sets the directory Claude starts in.

You can pass the command as a final argument to `new-session`
(`tmux new-session -d -s n -c d "claude ..."`). That works with no opening prompt,
but it makes feeding a first prompt awkward. See below.

## Feeding the first prompt

To start Claude and hand it an opening message, start a shell in the tmux session
and type the command into it with `send-keys`:

```bash
SEED='Audit this repo for TODOs and summarise what you find.'
SEED_ESC=$(printf '%q' "$SEED")
tmux send-keys -t myagent \
  "claude --remote-control \"myagent\" --dangerously-skip-permissions $SEED_ESC" Enter
```

`send-keys` sends its argument to the shell as literal keystrokes, and the shell
parses that line. A seed prompt is arbitrary text: spaces, quotes, `$`, backticks,
newlines. Without quoting, spaces split it into separate arguments, and `$(...)`
or backticks run as command substitution before Claude sees them.

`printf '%q'` produces a shell-safe version of the string that parses back to the
original as a single argument, with no splitting and no substitution. Quote the
seed; don't drop it in raw.

With no seed prompt, the simpler form is fine and Claude just starts interactive:
`tmux new-session -d -s myagent -c ~/myproject "claude --remote-control myagent --dangerously-skip-permissions"`.

## Getting back in

### Browser or app

At boot, Claude prints a Remote Control link:

```
https://claude.ai/code/session_XXXXXXXX
```

Open it in the web app or on your phone to drive the session. To read it from a
script, poll the pane until it appears:

```bash
for _ in $(seq 1 15); do
  sleep 1
  URL=$(tmux capture-pane -t myagent -p -S -200 \
        | grep -oE 'https://claude\.ai/code/session_[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+' | tail -1)
  [[ -n "$URL" ]] && break
done
echo "$URL"
```

`capture-pane -p` prints the pane text; `-S -200` includes the last 200 scrollback
lines, in case the link scrolled off. Give it a few seconds to register.

### Local tmux

```bash
tmux attach -t myagent
```

### SSH

```bash
ssh <user>@<host> -t tmux attach -t myagent
```

`-t` forces a TTY so tmux has a real terminal to attach to. Detach with `Ctrl-b d`
and the session keeps running. All three routes reach the same live session.

## Reference script

[`spawn-remote.sh`](spawn-remote.sh) is the recipe as one runnable script. It
checks prereqs, refuses to clobber an existing session, starts the detached tmux
session, feeds an optional seed prompt with the quoting above, captures the URL,
and prints the three ways to attach.

```bash
chmod +x spawn-remote.sh

./spawn-remote.sh <name> [dir] [seed-prompt]

# examples
./spawn-remote.sh myagent
./spawn-remote.sh myagent ~/myproject
./spawn-remote.sh myagent ~/myproject 'Find and fix the failing test.'
```

An agent can run it too, which is how one session starts the others.

## The security model, plainly

Questions worth answering before you run this:

- **These are not sandboxes.** Every workbench is a full process on the same
  machine, as the same user. A bench can read another bench's files. If you want
  real isolation between pieces of work, that's separate Unix users, containers,
  or separate machines; this recipe doesn't provide it.
- **A dedicated box is itself a boundary.** Running unattended agents with
  permissions skipped on your own laptop puts your SSH keys, browser sessions,
  and everything else you care about in the blast radius. Running them on a VPS
  that holds only the work confines the worst case to the box. That isn't
  sandboxing in the strict sense, but it is most of what people want from it.
- **Your claude.ai account becomes a control surface for the machine.** Anyone
  who can open your session list can drive terminals on the box. Treat the
  account accordingly: strong auth, and don't share it.
- **Keep a human on anything that leaves the machine.** Skipped permissions
  should mean the agent acts freely inside the box, not outside it. The gates,
  and how to write them down, are in [WIRING.md](WIRING.md).

## Requirements and notes

- tmux and the `claude` CLI on `PATH`.
- Run it on an always-on machine, such as a cheap VPS, so the terminals stay
  reachable any time, even when your own computer is off.
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` lets the agent run tools without asking. Only
  use it where you trust the environment.
- A blank `tmux capture-pane` from a running Claude session is normal; the
  full-screen UI doesn't render into the captured buffer. The boot URL still shows
  in the early scrollback, which is why the script polls right after launch.
